            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                
                Michael "MB" Stokol is an Australian multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger and music producer. Trained as a classical pianist and guitarist from a young age, his passions lie in music for video games and anime, where he aims to further pursue his music composition. Under his online alias “MB”, he enjoys making arrangements of video game music with online groups such as Resonant Union and KodamaSounds, to show his appreciation for the many artists that have inspired him across the years.
                
                <br> <br>

                As one of the core leaders of the Resonant Union initiative, he jointly organises and produces arrangement albums for video game soundtracks. His work on various fan-arrangement albums for music from the Xeno Series and Nihon Falcom’s catalogue of games provided him with the opportunity to work on GREEN ARRANGE, an official arrangement album for the video game ZeroRanger produced in collaboration with its Finnish developers System Erasure, working with many other talented video game composers from around the world.

                <br> <br>

                Whilst at The University of Melbourne, he had the opportunity to record two short chamber ensemble works in Brian Brown Recording Studio, as well as compose music for a 44-piece orchestra, 18-piece jazz big band, and 12-piece guitar ensemble.

                <br> <br>

                With his passion, dedication and experience with video game music, Michael is eager to utilize his skills on projects and collaborate with artists to create specialized music, helping to bring each project to life through music.
